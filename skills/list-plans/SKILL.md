You are executing the "/list-plans" protocol.

1. **Scan Plans:** List all subdirectories inside `.plan/` — each one is a plan. If there are none, tell me: *"No plans found. Start one with `/plan-task` (small task) or `/plan-feature` (multi-phase feature)."* Then stop.
2. **Read Active:** Check `.plan/.active` to see which plan is currently focused (if any).
3. **Show Progress:** For each plan folder, read its `plan.md` and count:
   - `[x]` checkboxes = completed phases
   - `[ ]` checkboxes = remaining phases
4. **Display Summary:** Print a table like this:

   ```
   Plans:
   ──────────────────────────────────────────
     Name              Progress    Status
   ──────────────────────────────────────────
   * user-auth         2/4 ████░░  Active
     shopping-cart     0/3 ░░░░░░
     payment-flow      3/3 ██████  Complete
   ──────────────────────────────────────────
   * = currently active
   ```

5. **Ask to Focus:** Use `AskUserQuestion` with the question *"Which plan would you like to focus on?"* and one option per plan name, plus a `Keep current` option if a plan is already active.
6. **Set Active:** Write the chosen plan name as a single line into `.plan/.active`.
7. **Confirm:** Tell me: *"Now focused on **[chosen-name]**. Run `/plan-phase` to detail the next phase, or `/execute` to run it immediately."*
